            <p> Adventures in "The Nice Chicago" we visit Toronto. Canadians
            are lovely people - sweet, helpful, considerate. <br>We also visited the AGO museum and saw this wonderful
            Frank Gehry design.   </p>

            <p>  Feeling like we have the Smugglers Blues, crossing border at 1am.
            We have no contraband but a reasonable amount of Coca-Cola we do have
            in the trunk, officer.  Everything went fine and we had re-entry.</p>
